# NFT Marketplace Theme

This is my first project using Tailwind CSS, where I built a responsive NFT marketplace theme to explore and learn Tailwind's styling capabilities. Completed quickly as a learning exercise, the project showcases foundational design elements and layout structuring using Tailwind.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styled entirely with Tailwind for a clean and utility-first approach.
- **NFT Marketplace Theme**: Basic layout to represent a marketplace UI.
